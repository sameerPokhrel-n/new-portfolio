          With a background in computer science and more than 2 years of
          hands-on experience in the field, I thrive on turning innovative ideas
          into reality through code. My journey in web development began when I
          discovered the limitless potential of the MERN stack. In addition to
          technical skills, I am a strong advocate for collaboration and
          effective communication.Outside of coding, I enjoy staying updated
          with the latest web development trends and technologies. I'm a
          lifelong learner who loves tackling new challenges and embracing
          emerging tools to enhance my skill set.
